            The Sunrisers Hyderabad (often abbreviated as SRH) are a franchise cricket team based in Hyderabad,
            Telangana, India, that plays in the Indian Premier League (IPL). The franchise is owned by Kalanithi
            Maran of the Sun TV Network and was founded in 2012 after the Hyderabad-based Deccan Chargers were
            terminated by the IPL. The team is currently captained by David Warner and coached by Trevor Bayliss.
            The primary homeground of the team is the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium, Hyderabad with a
            capacity of 55,000.

            The brand value of the Sunrisers Hyderabad was estimated to be ₹483 crore (US$68 million) in 2019 as the
            overall brand of IPL was increased to ₹47,000 crore (US$6.6 billion), according to Duff & Phelps.

            The team made their first IPL appearance in 2013, where they reached the playoffs, eventually finishing in
            fourth place. The SunRisers won their maiden IPL title in the 2016 season, defeating Royal Challengers
            Bangalore by 8 runs in the final. The team has qualified for the play-off stage of the tournament in every
            season since 2016. In 2018, the team reached the finals of the Indian Premier League, but lost to Chennai
            Super Kings by 8 Wickets, following a century by Shane Watson. The team is considered one of the best
            bowling sides, often admired for its ability to defend low totals. David Warner is the leading run scorer
            for the side, having won the Orange Cap 3 times, in 2015, 2017, and 2019. Bhuvneshwar Kumar is the
            leading wicket-taker.<br>
