            The Delhi Capitals are a franchise cricket team that represents the city of Delhi in the Indian Premier
            League (IPL). Founded in 2008 as the Delhi Daredevils, the franchise is jointly owned by the GMR Group and
            the JSW Group. The team's home ground is Arun Jaitley Stadium, located in New Delhi.

            The Delhi Capitals are the only current team to have never appeared in an IPL final[2] and qualified for the
            IPL playoffs in 2019 for the first time in seven years. The leading run-scorer for the Capitals is
            Virender Sehwag, while the leading wicket-taker is Amit Mishra.

            The IPL is a cricket league organised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and backed by the
            International Cricket Council (ICC). The inaugural tournament was held in April–June 2008, in which BCCI
            finalised a list of eight teams who participated in the tournament. The teams represented eight different
            cities in India, including Delhi. The teams were put up for auction in Mumbai on 20 February 2008, and the
            Delhi team was bought by the property development company GMR Group for US$84 million.

            In March 2018, GMR sold a 50% stake in the Delhi Daredevils to JSW Sports for ₹550 crore (US$77 million).

            In December 2018, the team changed its name from the Delhi Daredevils to the Delhi Capitals. Speaking to
            the rationale behind changing the team's name, co-owner and chairman Parth Jindal said, "Delhi is the power
            centre of the country, it is the capital, therefore the name Delhi Capitals." Co-owner Kiran Kumar
            Grandhi said, "The new name symbolizes Delhi’s identity and just like the city, we are aiming to be the
            centre of all action going forward.

            cricket team. He played for the India Under-19 cricket team at the 2014 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup.

            In February 2015, Iyer was signed in the 2015 IPL players auction by the Delhi Daredevils for 2.6 crores
            (approximately $430,000). Thus Iyer became the highest earning uncapped player in the tournament. He scored
            439 runs in 14 matches, with a 33.76 average and a strike rate of 128.36, making him the 9th most consistent

            He was retained by Delhi Daredevils in the 2018 IPL Auction. On 25 April 2018, he was announced as the new
            captain of Delhi Daredevils replacing Gautam Gambhir. On 27 April 2018, he became the youngest
            captain to lead the Delhi Daredevils team in the IPL history at the age of 23 years and 142 days during the
            match against Kolkata Knight Riders and was also the fourth overall youngest to captain any IPL side. On
            his IPL captaincy debut, Shreyas Iyer smashed an unbeaten match winning knock of 93 off 40 deliveries with
            10 sixes, which was his third successive IPL fifty of the season to power DD to a heavy total of 219/5 in
            the first innings of the match before earning him the man of the match award. Under his captaincy, Delhi
            Daredevils managed to defeat KKR by 55 runs to secure only their second win of the tournament. He
            was retained by the Delhi Capitals in the IPL 2019 Season which he led the team into the playoffs for the
            first time after seven years.
