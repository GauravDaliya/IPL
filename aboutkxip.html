            The Kings XI Punjab (KXIP) are a franchise cricket team based in Mohali (Chandigarh CR), Punjab, that plays
            in the Indian Premier League (IPL). Established in 2008, the franchise is jointly owned by Mohit Burman,
            Ness Wadia, Preity Zinta and Karan Paul. The team plays its home matches at the PCA Stadium, Mohali. Since
            the 2010 IPL, they have been playing some of their home games at either Dharamsala or Indore.

            The Kings XI Punjab's catchment areas are Kashmir, Jammu, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Haryanaâ€”evident from
            the letter sequence "K J H P H" in the banner of the team's logo. Apart from the 2014 season when they
            topped the league table and finished runners-up, the team has made only one other playoff appearance in 12
            seasons.

            In 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) created the cricket tournament the Indian Premier
            League based on the Twenty20 format of the game. Franchises for eight cities were made available in an
            auction held in Mumbai on 20 February 2008. The team representing Punjab was bought by the Dabur group's
            Mohit Burman (46%), the Wadia group's Ness Wadia (23%), Preity Zinta (23%), and Saptarshi Dey of the Dey &
            Dey Group (minor stake). The group paid a total of $76 million to acquire the franchise.

            Kannur Lokesh Rahul[1] (born 18 April 1992), commonly known as KL Rahul, is an Indian international
            cricketer who plays for Karnataka in domestic cricket and captains Kings XI Punjab in the Indian Premier
            League. He is a right-handed batsman and a wicket-keeper.

            Rahul made his international debut in 2014 and scored his maiden Test century in his second Test match. He
            became the first Indian to score a century on One Day International debut, and became the third Indian to
            score a century in all three formats of international cricket.

            Rahul made his Indian Premier League (IPL) debut for Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) as a wicket-keeper
            batsman during the 2013 competition. Ahead of the 2014 IPL, he was bought by the Sunrisers Hyderabad for INR
            1 crore, before returning to RCB ahead of the 2016 IPL season. He finished the season as the 11th highest
            run-scorer, and RCB's third, with 397 runs from 14 matches. For his performances in the 2016 IPL season, he
            was named as wicket keeper in the Cricinfo and Cricbuzz IPL XI. Rahul missed the 2017 season due to
            a shoulder injury.

            In the 2018 IPL Auction, he was bought by Kings XI Punjab for INR 11 crore, the joint-third highest price.
            In the team's first match of the season he scored the fastest 50 in IPL history, taking 14 balls to reach
            the milestone and breaking the record of Sunil Narine. For his performances in the 2018 IPL season,
            he was named in the Cricinfo and Cricbuzz IPL XI. After making scores of 90+ three times during
            2018, he reached his maiden IPL century in 2019, scoring 100 not out from 64 against Mumbai Indians. For his
            performances in the 2019 IPL season, he was named in the Cricinfo IPL XI.

            Rahul will captain Kings XI Punjab in the 2020 IPL, after former captain Ravichandran Ashwin was traded to
            Dehli Capitals
